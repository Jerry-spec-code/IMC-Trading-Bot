1. Market trades (how do they work)
2. VWAP, TWAP.


Examples: 
"PRODUCT1": OrderDepth(
  buy_orders={10: 7, 9: 5},
  sell_orders={11: -4, 12: -8}
);
Position limit of 10.

Conjecture: VWAP -> to determine market price. (maybe other stuff)

Case 1: The past does not exist

VWAP (bid): (10 * 7 + 9 * 5) / (7 + 5) = 9.58
VWAP (ask): (11 * 4 + 12 * 8) / (4 + 8) = 11.67

Liquidity:
Help other companies buy/sell large quantities of shares.
VWAP helps determine fair price to charge clients.
Spread. Diff between bid and ask price at a certain point in time.

Volume that we trade at changes how much we trade as well as how much money to trade

Ask price always higher than bid price, so must buy at ask price such that we think the bid price will eventually exceed that specific ask price.


Hyptoehtical Example:
@ time: 10:00am:



Case 2: The past is coming back to haunt us

"PRODUCT1": 

OrderDepth(
  buy_orders={10: 7, 9: 5},
  sell_orders={11: -4, 12: -8}
);

PastOrder as of yesterday:
market_trades = {
	"PRODUCT1": [
		Trade(
			symbol="PRODUCT1",
			price=8,
			quantity=6,
			buyer="",
			seller="",
			timestamp=100
		)
	],
}

VWAP (buy): (10 * 7 + 9 * 5 + 8 * 6) / (7 + 5 + 6) = 9.0555555
VWAP (sell): (11 * 4 + 12 * 8 + 8 * 6) / (4 + 8 + 6) = 10.44444444

market_trades -> can contain transactions between two bots. 
  
All market participants submitting their orders, 
Any orders that we put in will be matched to the order depths available. 
Players -> inf fast execution (can trade with any bot order they see in the trading state).
However, after all orders cancelled, bots can trade against each other at price level of player's order.

Do we want to weight the weights? (Older data -> less relevance).
